# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Create a responsive “HAND FOR ALL (HOF)” landing page hero/header and supporting sections that present the project overview, features, applications, and contact information with a dark theme and cyan accents.

**Planned changes:**
- Build a responsive hero/header that displays the brand name “HAND FOR ALL”, logo text “HOF - Hand For All”, main title “Prosthetic Hand Using Soft Robots”, and tagline “Innovating Human Capability with Soft Robotics”.
- Add a “Key Features” section with the six provided feature titles and descriptions, responsive as single-column on mobile and grid on larger screens.
- Add a “How It Works” section with the provided paragraph text verbatim and make it visually distinct from adjacent sections.
- Add an “Applications” section listing: Medical Rehab, Assistive Tech, and R&D (Research and Development).
- Add a “Contact” section showing the provided email (mailto) and both phone numbers (tel) with readable, accessible labeling on a dark background.
- Apply consistent styling across the page: dark charcoal/black background, white text, and light blue/cyan accents with a modern soft-robotics/engineering feel.
- Add and reference three generated static images from `frontend/public/assets/generated`, with responsive behavior and English alt text.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can view a polished, responsive landing page that clearly communicates the HAND FOR ALL project, its key features and operation, applications, and direct contact details, supported by relevant imagery.
