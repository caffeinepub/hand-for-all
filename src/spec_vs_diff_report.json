  "summary": "Diff adds a new landing-page style App with hero header and one required hero image reference, plus introduces Internet Identity/react-query hooks and a stub backend actor. Due to truncation, several requested sections (features details, how-it-works copy, applications list, contact details, and the other two required images) cannot be verified from the provided diff summary.",
